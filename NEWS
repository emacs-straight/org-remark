Current development version

  - chg: `org-remark-global-tracking-mode' has been simplified.

         This is not expected to break the user's workflow or configuration
         -- simply removing a superfluous feature.   

         .org-remark-tracking file is no longer necessary and can be safely
         deleted from the user's Emacs configuraiton directory if present.
         Automatic activation of `org-remark-mode' is done by looking the
         presence of a marginal notes file for current buffer open.

         `org-remark-global-tracking-mode' itself is still relevant and
         recommended to be setup as was previously in the user manual.

  - add: Option to use relative links from the marginal notes back to the source

         Adding user option org-remark-source-path-function.  The default is
         file-relative-name.

  - add: Adding a new option to org-remark-notes-file-path to use a function

         Its default function is org-remark-notes-file-path-function.  It
         returns a file name like this: "FILE-notes.org" by adding
         "-notes.org" as a suffix to the file name without the extension.

* Changes

  - chg: `remove' (and delete) only removes one highlight at a time instead of
         remove all at point

  - chg: Save marginal notes on `mark' instead of wainting for `save'

  - chg: define org-remark-mark explicitly for autoload cookie

  - chg: `org-remark-view' and `org-remark-open'. View will stay in the
          current main note; open will move the cursor to the marginal notes
          buffer for further editing.

  - chg: When updating the existing headline and position properties, don't
         update the headline text when it already exists. Let the user decide
         how to manage headlines.
