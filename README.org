[This notice written on 18 January 2022]

Happy 2022!

I have changed the name of the project and package to "*Org-remark*" from Org-marginalia. 

If you are using Org-marginalia now, there are breaking changes. This package includes the feature that automatically converts the old Org-marginalia data into the new Org-remark data. Add ~org-remark-convert-legacy~ feature like this:

#+begin_src elisp
  (require 'org-remark-convert-legacy)
#+end_src

This feature is designed to work automatically and transparently to you, meaning you should not have to do anything, as long as you did not customize ~org-marginala-notes-file-path~. If you did, you also need to customize ~org-remark-notes-file-path~. You can also manually do data conversion if you wish. For more detail, refer to the docstring of function ~org-remark-convert-legacy-data~. 

* Introduction

Org-remark lets you highlight and annotate any text file with using Org mode.

A user manual is available [[https://nobiot.github.io/org-remark/][online]] (Info node will be available when Org-remark is added to ELPA/MELPA).

For installation and minimum configuration, refer to [[#installation][Installation]] below or the user manual: [[https://nobiot.github.io/org-remark/#Installation][online]].

Getting Started in the user manual will get you started in 5 minutes: [[https://nobiot.github.io/org-remark/#getting-started][online]].

For customization, refer to the customization group `org-transclusion' or user manual: [[https://nobiot.github.io/org-remark/#Customizing][online]].

An [[https://youtu.be/c8DHrAsFiLc][introductory video]] (8 minutes) is available on YouTube.

* Installation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: installation
:END:

This package is not available on ELPA or MELPA yet. Manual installation is required.

Ensure to have Org Mode 9.4 or later (tested on 9.4.2). This package uses ~org-collect-keywords~, which does not exist in an earlier version.

Store all the =.el= files in the repo in your load-path and put this in your
init file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Set `load-path' , load `org-remark-global-tracking', and turn it on for
  ;; automatic loading of highlights for the files tracked
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/local-repos/org-remark")
  (require 'org-remark-global-tracking)
  (org-remark-global-tracking-mode +1)
#+end_src

Unless you explicitly load ~org~ during Emacs initialization, I suggest to defer loading ~org-remark~ (thus there is no ~(require 'org-remark)~ in the example above). This is because it will also pull in ~org~, which can slow down initialization. You can control the timing of loading ~org-remark~ by autoloading some commands in a similar way with the example keybindings below.

Below are example keybindings you might like to consider:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Key-bind `org-remark-mark' to global-map so that you can call it globally
  ;; before the library is loaded.  In order to make `org-remark-mark' and
  ;; `org-remark-mode' callable, use `autoload'.
  (autoload #'org-remark-mark "org-remark" nil t)
  (autoload #'org-remark-mode "org-remark" nil t)
  (define-key global-map (kbd "C-c n m") #'org-remark-mark)

  ;; The rest of keybidings are done only on loading `org-remark'
  (with-eval-after-load 'org-remark
    (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n o") #'org-remark-open)
    (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n ]") #'org-remark-view-next)
    (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n [") #'org-remark-view-prev)
    (define-key org-remark-mode-map (kbd "C-c n r") #'org-remark-remove))
#+end_src

This section is created by Org-remark for the source file. It serves as an example to illustrate what Org-remark can do.

** defmacro org-remark-create

This macro was inspired by [[https://github.com/jkitchin/ov-highlight][Ov-highlight]].  It's by John Kitchin (author of Org-ref). Great UX for markers with hydra. Saves the marker info and comments directly within the Org file as Base64 encoded string. It uses overlays with using ~ov~ package.
