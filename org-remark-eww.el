;;; Commentary:
;;  This file is part of org-remark.

;;  This feature to support for EWW was originally added by Vedang
;;  Manerika with commit 5e4b27ar feat: Support taking annotations in eww
;;  buffers.  nobit has refactored it as a separate file.

;;; Code:

(require 'eww)
;; Silence compiler
(defvar org-remark-global-tracking-mode)
(declare-function org-remark-auto-on "org-remark-global-tracking")

(defun org-remark-eww-enable ()
  (if org-remark-global-tracking-mode
      (add-hook 'eww-after-render-hook #'org-remark-auto-on)
    (remove-hook 'eww-after-render-hook #'org-remark-auto-on))
  ;; TODO allow for disable with org-remark-mode-hook (local)

  (add-hook 'org-remark-highlight-link-to-source-functions
            #'org-remark-eww-highlight-link-to-source))
